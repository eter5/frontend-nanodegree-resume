+ HOBBIES AND INTERESTS

In 1985 at the age of nine, I made my first program on a Commodore 64 personal computer using BASIC. Computer science has been my passion ever since. I consider myself an open, positive, happy, and responsible person. I learn fast, communicate effectively, and work well with teams. I’m a padawan of life.
